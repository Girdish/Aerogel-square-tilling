Aerogel Square Tilling for DRICH radiator
========================================
  
The aerogel radiator previously used in the DRICH geometry was a simple conical structure without any internal support. This update introduces a practical design on how it will be constructed and assembled within the detector.

Changes made to aerogel radiator geometry:                                                
1. **Ribs have been added** to create a square tiling pattern across the aerogel, representing individual tiles.
2. These **grids are embedded** within the aerogel volume .
3. An **outer rim** has been added to provide structural support, matching the conical profile of the aerogel surface.
4. Parameters such as the **number of tiles, rim width, rib thickness**, and **material types** are now defined in the XML configuration file:
